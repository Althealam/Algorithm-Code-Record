# Algorithm-Code-Record

Welcome to my collection of algorithm solutions! This repository serves as a personal archive of all the problems I've solved on platforms like LeetCode. It's designed to be a quick reference for me to review solutions and also serves as a learning resource for others interested in algorithmic problem-solving.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into several categories based on the type of algorithm or data structure involved. Each category contains folders for individual problems, and each problem may have multiple solutions represented by different Python files.

### Categories

- **[Binary Trees](https://github.com/Althealam/Algorithm-Code-Record/tree/main/%E4%BA%8C%E5%8F%89%E6%A0%91)**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Strings**
- **Arrays**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Linked Lists**
